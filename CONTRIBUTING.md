# Contributing to omp-deck

Thanks for your interest. omp-deck is a small enough project that there is no
heavyweight process — but a few conventions keep the codebase tidy.

## Repo layout

```
apps/
  server/          # Bun + Hono backend that embeds @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent
  web/             # Vite + React + Tailwind frontend
  bridges/
    telegram/      # Standalone Bun process — long-poll Telegram bridge
packages/
  protocol/        # Dep-free shared types (REST + WS frames)
docs/              # Markdown documentation site
```

Workspaces are wired through Bun's `workspaces` field in the root `package.json`.

## Required worktree policy

Every change to omp-deck, including code, tests, configuration, and documentation,
MUST be made from a dedicated task worktree and feature branch. The primary
checkout is read-only for development work. Never edit, run a development server
from, or generate build artifacts in that checkout.

Create the worktree from the configured integration branch, make and verify the
change there, then merge it through the normal review flow. The primary checkout
may be used only to fetch, inspect, and create or remove worktrees.

## Dev loop

```sh
bun install
bun run dev          # spawns server (8787) + vite (5173) in parallel
```

If you want them in separate terminals:

```sh
bun run dev:server
bun run dev:web
```

The telegram bridge only runs on demand (Settings → Messaging → Start, or `bun run dev:telegram`).

## Developing without disrupting your daily-driver deck

`bun --hot` re-evaluates `apps/server/src/index.ts` on every save and Vite
hot-reloads `apps/web/src/**` in place. That's great for the inner loop but
it also means a single working tree can't host a "production" deck you're
using and a "dev" deck you're iterating on simultaneously — every edit
bounces the deck you're chatting in.

The fix is a parallel checkout via `git worktree`, env-isolated:

```sh
# from the existing checkout
git worktree add ../omp-deck-dev -b dev/<feature>
cd ../omp-deck-dev
bun install
cat > .env <<'EOF'
OMP_DECK_PORT=8889
OMP_DECK_WEB_PORT=5273
OMP_DECK_DB_PATH=$PWD/apps/server/data/deck.dev.db
OMP_DECK_DATA_DIR=$PWD/.deck-data
EOF
bun run dev      # dev deck lives at http://127.0.0.1:5273
```

The two instances now share **history only**. Five env vars give you full
state separation:

| Concern                  | prod tree            | dev worktree                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Server port              | `OMP_DECK_PORT=8787` | `OMP_DECK_PORT=8889`             |
| Web (Vite) port          | `5173`               | `OMP_DECK_WEB_PORT=5273`         |
| Kanban / inbox / routines| `deck.db`            | `deck.dev.db`                    |
| Managed `.env`, audit log| default `DATA_DIR`   | `OMP_DECK_DATA_DIR=.deck-data`   |
| OAuth credentials + sessions | `~/.omp/agent/`  | same by default; set `OMP_AGENT_DIR` to isolate when testing the OAuth flow itself |

Leave `OMP_AGENT_DIR` unset for routine dev so you don't re-login to Claude /
Codex on every dev iteration. Set it to a fresh dir only when the change
under test touches `auth.db` and you need to repeatedly clear the
no-credentials state.

Merge the branch back when ready; `git worktree remove ../omp-deck-dev`
tears down the tree but keeps the branch and its commits.

### What survives vs. dies on restart

Survives on disk: tasks, inbox, routines, run history, session transcripts,
auth credentials, settings.

Dies on server restart: in-flight WS streams, in-progress agent turns,
in-memory session caches, half-completed OAuth flows (the SDK's loopback
listener is the recipient — losing the process loses the listener).

That's exactly why the worktree pattern matters: your "I'm using it right
now" deck only restarts when **you** decide to merge and bounce it.

## Code quality

- `bun run typecheck` must pass before opening a PR.
- `bun run --filter '@omp-deck/web' build` must build clean.
- New REST routes go through `packages/protocol` types — no `any` at the wire.
- New SDK touchpoints go through `apps/server/src/bridge` — the route layer
  must not import `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` directly.
- WS broadcast frames go through `apps/server/src/broadcast-bus.ts`.
- Deck slash commands live in `apps/server/src/deck-slash-commands.ts`.

## Testing changes

Bun test runs across server + web + protocol workspaces:

```sh
bun test                  # all workspaces
cd apps/server && bun test
cd apps/web && bun test
```

Coverage is partial — heavy on the bridge layer (plan-mode, queue shadow,
todo synthesis, ext-ui dialogs, reducer event handling) and DB layer
(tasks, routines, notifications, deck-action steps). UI components +
routes are still primarily verified end-to-end via:

1. `bun run typecheck` across every workspace.
2. Manual browser smoke against `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
3. API smokes — small PowerShell or curl scripts under `.logs/` (gitignored).

When you add a feature with non-trivial state, ship at least the
bridge-side test alongside it. Reducer cases want a unit test apiece —
look at `apps/web/src/lib/reducer.test.ts` for the pattern.

## Style

- TypeScript strict mode is on. No `// @ts-ignore` without a justification comment.
- Tailwind tokens through the theme system (`rgb(var(--token) / <alpha-value>)`).
  Do not introduce raw hex colors outside `apps/web/src/styles.css`.
- React: function components, hooks. No class components, no HOCs.
- Server: Hono + Bun. No Express.

## Commits

Conventional Commits welcome but not enforced. Keep messages descriptive —
"fix bug" is not enough; "fix: kanban refetch missed broadcast on inbox-promote"
is.

## Filing issues

If you hit a bug, a minimal repro plus your `bun --version`, OS, and
`@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` version is all we need.
